multialbum.update.metadata.description=Renumber all tracks so that 1-01 would be 001 (again this is in the metadata, not the file name you see in the pic) and if disc 1 ended with 1-11 it would be 011 and then 2-01 starting disc 2 would be 012.  So everything would be ordered sequentially up to 999 (thus ensuring there are no albums with that many tracks across multiple discs) and would appear in the metadata to belong to a single, large disc.  The file names would be unchanged, so if you opened the folder it would still look sorted exactly as above, just as you'd expect it to be played.  It's just that now with the metadata edit would reinforce that sorting in other apps accessing the file structure.
